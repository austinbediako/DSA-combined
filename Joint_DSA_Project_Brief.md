**Joint DSA Semester Project**

**Ghana Smart Service Operations Optimizer**

A practical project integrating algorithm design, empirical analysis, linear and hierarchical data structures, graph algorithms, database storage, correctness testing and performance reporting.

| Course | DCIT 204/308 Data Structures and Algorithms I&II |
|----|----|
| Project mode | Team project: 12-16 students, with individual accountability |
| Recommended duration | **4 weeks** |
| Recommended language | Java; database may be SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL |
| Final output | Working system, source code, database, tests, performance graphs, technical report and oral defense |

# 1. Project overview

Students will build a realistic Ghana-context service operations platform that stores local operational data in a database, loads the data into custom-built data structures, applies algorithms to solve operational problems, verifies correctness, measures efficiency as input sizes increase, and presents evidence using tables and graphs. The recommended scenario is a Smart Service Operations Optimizer for a campus, municipality, hospital, logistics firm, ride dispatch service, waste-collection team, emergency-response team, or library-resource system in Ghana. Each team must select one local context and adapt the data, locations, service rules and constraints to that context.

> *This is not a UI-design project. The core marks are for correct data-structure implementation, algorithmic reasoning, empirical analysis, testing, database integration and clarity of explanation.*

# 2. Industry scenario and Ghana localisation

Your organisation operates across a local Ghanaian environment. It receives service requests, stores them in a database, prioritises urgent jobs, assigns resources, finds routes between locations, monitors connectivity between zones, supports search and reporting, and evaluates algorithm performance.

| **Allowed local contexts** | **Example data students must adapt locally** |
|:---|:---|
| University campus service hub | hostels, lecture halls, labs, shuttle stops, maintenance requests, lab-resource movement |
| Hospital or clinic operations | departments, patients, urgency levels, pharmacy requests, dispatch routes |
| Municipal waste or sanitation routing | communities, collection points, truck routes, priority areas |
| Courier or food delivery service | vendors, customer zones, riders, parcel priority, route network |
| Library or records office | book/request records, shelves, issue queues, search indexes |

## AI-resistance and localisation requirements

1.  Each team must use a Ghanaian local context and submit a short evidence note explaining how the dataset was obtained or constructed from local knowledge without exposing personal data.

2.  The dataset must include local names of places, routes, service categories and realistic constraints such as traffic, distance, urgency, operating hours, limited vehicles or staff.

3.  Each team must derive at least three algorithm parameters from member index numbers, for example priority weight, route penalty, hash-table size, random seed or budget constraint.

4.  Each team must include trace tables for selected algorithms. Generic code without trace evidence will be treated as incomplete.

5.  Every member must defend one data structure and one algorithm during the oral demonstration.

# 3. Core problem statement

Design and implement a system that answers operational questions such as the following:

1.  Which service request should be handled next under FIFO, urgency, and priority-based rules?

2.  What is the fastest route from one local location to another under weighted-road conditions?

3.  Which locations are reachable from the current dispatch point?

4.  Which subset of requests or resources can be selected under a budget, capacity or time constraint?

5.  How do alternative data structures and algorithms perform as the dataset grows?

6.  How can the system store records permanently and reload them for later analysis?

# 4. Minimum dataset and database requirements

| **Data entity** | **Minimum records** | **Required fields** |
|----|----|----|
| Locations | 50 | locationId, name, area, type, latitude/longitude or local coordinates |
| Roads/edges | 100 | fromLocationId, toLocationId, distance, travelTime, roadConditionWeight |
| Service requests | 300 | requestId, source, destination, category, urgency, timeSubmitted, deadline, status |
| Resources | 30 | resourceId, type, homeLocation, capacity, availabilityStatus |
| Algorithm runs | 30 | runId, algorithmName, inputSize, timeNs, memoryKb, dateRun |

Students may use CSV files to seed the database, but the final program must read from and write to the database. The database is not only storage; it must be part of the running system.

## Suggested database schema

|:---|:---|
| locations | Stores all nodes in the local service network. |
| roads | Stores weighted edges between locations. |
| service_requests | Stores jobs that will be queued, prioritised, searched and sorted. |
| resources | Stores vehicles, officers, staff, riders or assets that can be assigned. |
| algorithm_runs | Stores empirical runtime measurements and input-size metadata. |
| audit_events | Stores stack-based undo/audit operations and important system events. |

# 15. Academic integrity and AI-resistance controls

1.  Every team must use a distinct Ghanaian local context and dataset. Copying a generic online logistics, hospital or campus example without localisation will lose marks.

2.  The report must include team-specific trace outputs generated from the team dataset and index-number parameters.

3.  The examiner may ask students to modify a priority rule, add a new location, change a hash table size, or rerun an algorithm live.

4.  Students must submit a short development log showing weekly progress, challenges and decisions.

5.  Generic explanations without code evidence, tests, runtime data and database screenshots will not be accepted as complete.

6.  All AI assistance, if used, must be acknowledged, and students must be able to explain and modify their own implementation **(with the supporting prompts used)**.
